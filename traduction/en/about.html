        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p class="descr-main">Hi, I am Aurélien Moignet I am currently in my first year of BTS Digital System
                              option Computer Science & Networks.</p>
        <p>After having obtained my general baccalaureate in mathematics and engineering sciences last year.
           I decided to continue my studies in a BTS where one of my passions, computer science, is taught to me.
           We work on a multitude of things first of all the programming that it is part of the web (HTML, PHP, CSS, JS)
           but also industrial programming (C, C++, Perl). I am also networking on Linux.</p>
        <p>I am a person motivated by work and especially by the fact of progressing continuously.
           It's been 2 years now that I realize small personal project as this one in order to improve myself of
           project on project. I also like teamwork, this skill I have developed before all in my club
           soccer, but also during the projects carried out in Engineering Science (Our project: Design of a model of
           cutlery distribution). I am an independent person, I know how to get to work quickly.</p>
        <p>You can see some of the projects I have done in the project section by hovering over the "I am" text
           on the home page</p>
